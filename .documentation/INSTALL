INSTALL
=======

Just run install.sh.

In case of failure, try manually copying the Git folder into either
~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts, ~/.gnome/nautilus-scripts,
~/Nautilus/scripts or ~/.nautilus/scripts, depending on the versions
of GNOME and Nautilus you have.

The scripts are using zenity for user interaction.

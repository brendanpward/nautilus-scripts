This is a collection of scripts for use in the Nautilus file browser.

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

These scripts are based on the SVN Nautilus Scripts 0.9 written by Marius Scurtescu
(http://marius.scurtescu.com/?p=102). They, in turn, are based on the CVS Nautilus
Scripts written by Gavin Brown (http://jodrell.net/projects/nautilus-cvs-scripts).
They were subsequently copied from Tapio (https://github.com/tapio/nautilus-git-scripts/),
